# Detectify-AI Object Detection

## About This Project

**Detectify-AI** is an innovative mobile application designed to detect objects in real-time using your device's camera. By leveraging TensorFlow Lite and advanced AI models, the app identifies objects, draws bounding boxes around them, and displays confidence scores. Additionally, users can save detection results and view them in a detailed history section.

**With Detectify-AI, the power of artificial intelligence is at your fingertips for seamless object detection**
